Wait, my little light
My star and stripe
My only one
My.... why don't we try
be like we used to
start it over

If you want it
I could be anyone - anything
Just don't go yet
Tell me life I'll believe
so please

Say a little more
Say a little more
Say you wanted me
Say anything

Say a little more
Say a little more
Say you wanted me
Say anything

So I can change
And I won't convice you
To walk my way
Pretend it's OK

Just stay, my little sigh
My star and stripe
My only one

and Say a little more
Say a little more
Say you wanted me
Say anything

Say a little more
Say a little more
Say you wanted me
Say anything

------------

I wouldn't leave you
I wouldn't leave you
No, I wouldn't leave you
I couldn't leave you

I couldn't leave you (x4)
